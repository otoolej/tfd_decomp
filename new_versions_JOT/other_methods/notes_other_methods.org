** VMD: variational mode decomposition
   + minimisation problem to find IMF (mode, = component) by searching for centre frequencies
   + uses ADMM (alternate direction method of multipliers) to solve
     - quadratic penalty function alpha, and 'Lagrangian multipliers', for constrained optimisation
   + periodically extends signals by mirroring

** synchrosqueeze methods
   + a type of reassignment method, which unlike other reassignment methods, allows for
     signal reconstruction (e.g. inverse STFT or inverse Wavelet)
   + assume the signal is stationary within the short-time analysis window
     - stationary assumption is that that derivative of both the IA and IF are almost zero
   + derivative of the STFT gives IF information, almost exactly
   + must be weakly time-varying (i.e. no strongly TV signals)
     
** variational nonlinear chirp mode decomposition (VNCMD)
   + demodulates components to stationary components and finds components similar to VMD
   + minimisation problem to find components by searching for IFs and IAs
   + method requires an initial estimate of IF and is sensitive to that value (i.e. see
     Fig. 4)
   + also requires an estimate of the SD of noise (assuming White Gaussian noise); if not
     able to do this, then need to turn off the Lagrangian multiplier lambda noise
     variable
   + estimates components uₖ and vₖ (IA and initial phase)
     - IF is estimated iteratively through uₖ and vₖ estimates
   + ADMM optimisation (using l2-norm)
   + requires initial estimate of the IF (as per VNCMD)     



** Time-varying EMD (TV-EMD)
*** reivew of other methods
   + Limitations of bog-standard EMD: 
     1. sensitive to noise (intermittence problem)
     2. can't resolve components that lie within an octave (separation problem), with a
        frequency ratio of above 0.65
     3. components must extend the whole duration of signal
     4. need to upsample (5 x Nyquist frequency, according to Nathan in ISSPA)
   + Limitation of ensemble EMD (EEMD):
     - difficult to select paramaters
     - can't extract TV (LFM) components (really? should test this)
   + In an example, both VMD and EWT perform poorly for noisy linear FM signal. Though for
     the VMD, number of components is set to 5 (and should be 2). VMD is sensitive to
     number of components
     - NOTE: maybe this is a limitation of the VMD/VNCMD methods, i.e. performance breaks
       down when incorrect components given
     - NOTE: 2020 method, 'successive VMD' may solve the mode problem
   + EMD can be viewed as a iterative low-pass filtering operation
   + @Nathan: check out references [31] and [32] for TV filtering methods

*** method
   + B-spline approximation is used as a filter (different to using B-splines to
     interpolate the envelopes, as per standard EMD)
   + time-varying filtering using B-spines, need to know where the knots are
   + need to estimate the time-varying cut-off frequency, and do so using some complicated
     analysis of the analytic estimates if IF and IA (from the analytic signal)
   + 2 parameters: ξ, related to bandwidth (default 0.1); n, related to order of splines
     (larger the better; default 28)
   + presumably, the limitation is still the EMD problem of finite duration of
     signals. TODO: test this
   + other limitation, closely spaced tones?


** S-method with SVD     
   + S-method: related to WVD (but not exact as using a smoothing window)
     - convolves STFTs together; window limits the convolution
     - equal to sum of WVDs for multicomponent signals (when signals well seperated)
     - Stankovic showed in TFSAP book that is just a qTFD with a separable kernel (Tukey
       for 1 window)
   + Eigenvalue decomposition on time--lag function R
   + can recover signals up to a constant phase and amplitude factor
   + need aprior information to recover amplitude (e.g. if know noise is strong then )
   + specific to high-frequency surface wave radar
   + Limitations: can only recover components up to a phase and amplitude constant

** NCME -- nonlinear chirp mode estimation
   + estimates components uₖ and vₖ (IA and initial phase)
     - IF is estimated iteratively through uₖ and vₖ estimates
   + ADMM optimisation
   + enforces sparsity:
     - double derivative of uₖ and vₖ (controlled by λ) using l1-norm
     - this the only difference to VNCMD?
   + requires initial estimate of the IF (as per VNCMD)
