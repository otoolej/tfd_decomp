* TODO next [5/7]
  + [X] try 2-tone test with iterative approach
    - doesn't seem to be any advantage for either the xTFD or TV-filt
  + [X] implement Nathan's edge linker into xTFD code; no improvement (i.e. the same) for test signals
    but slower so not added for now.
  + [X] include new method NCME
  + [X] 2-tone test again with components separated in time
  + [ ] add transient/blobs in with test signals
  + [ ] noise analysis (i.e. signal + noise)
  + [X] noisy signals (e.g. NIRS synth. signal)
    - use /wfbm/ function in Matlab
      + or ffgn (fractional Gaussian noise), where diff(wfbm) = ffgn; and cumsum(ffgn) = wfbm;
    - see study by Rilling and Flandrian (which uses fractional Gaussian noise)
